BulbaTrivia does not store any user data.

[Rollbar](https://rollbar.com) is used for error tracking. Data collected when an error occurs:

- `error`: The error message and stack trace
- `interaction`: The interaction + options used (ex. `/search [site<string>: example.com] [tags<string>: foo bar]`)

Errors reported to Rollbar are deleted after 30 days.

For a copy of your data, or to delete the data by request, you may contact the developer. Please note that you may be required to verify your identity and/or your permissions on a server before requests can be completed, to avoid unauthorized access or deletion of data.
